# Sources

This directory contains some OpenAPI definitions included in this project
solely for the purpose of testing various progenitor features. Some of these
have been pulled in from other projects:

- `api.github.com.json`: https://github.com/github/rest-api-description
- `buildomat.json`: https://github.com/oxidecomputer/buildomat
- `keeper.json`: https://github.com/jclulow/keeper
- `nexus.json`: https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron
- `propolis-server.json`: https://github.com/oxidecomputer/propolis
- `openai-openapi.yaml`: https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi

Note that keeper, buildomat and openai-openapi.yaml have diverged in order to validate support for various features.
The others should not be changed other than updating them from their source repository.
